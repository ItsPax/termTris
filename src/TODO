What do I need to do?

- Implement gameover
- Implement pause screen
- Implement an instructions screen that shows until the player presses enter
- Make the code not shit
- Implement a better choice than just placing them in the middle


BUGS:
- When pressing s at the very bottom, sometimes the game glitches out and I can't continue

THINGS I WANT TO IMPROVE:
- Dropping to the ghost block is very expensive, as generating the ghost appears to be really expensive; is there a way to speed it up?
