What do I need to do?

- Fix the colors so that they're truthful to the game
- Fix the randInts for all the tetronimos (how does tetris do it? emulate them)
- Show the player where is tetronimo is going to land if he fastfalls
- Implement tetronimo storing
- Implement correct fastfall 
- Implement gameover
- Implement pause screen
- Make the code not shit
